# Placed Light Patcher

This is a very simple Synthesis patcher that will forward the following from Placed Light: 
* Cell
    * Lighting
    * Lighting Template
* Light (if the winning record is using vanilla values)

When using this patcher, Placed Light should be as **high in your load order as possible**, so it doesn't overwrite important cell changes.
